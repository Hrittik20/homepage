# OBF Homepage New

This is a very basic version, I haven't styled anything or linked to the proper pages. 

-- Separated the header and footer from the main content.

--The sections in the index page are kept as separate posts in the dasboard for easy editing. As of now, the lists of the fellowships and news sections with HTML are in the 'content' part of the post too. 

-- Used this https://github.com/wp-bootstrap/wp-bootstrap-navwalker navwalker class to add items in the navbar dynamically via the dash as required. There's an issue with the styling of the navbar, but it might be some minor fault in the CSS. The menu doesn't seem to be working in the mobile version of this. Need to figure that out as well.

-- As of now, I've added the about, news and fellowships sections as posts editable directly from the wordpress editor. The links don't lead to any valid pages. For the events and projects, it could be better to just use custom posts like Yo recommended?
